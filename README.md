# Running Sims 3 FitGirl Repack installer under "new WoW64" Wine

My distro of choice, Arch Linux, transitioned its `wine` package to "new WoW64" in [June 2025](https://archlinux.org/news/transition-to-the-new-wow64-wine-and-wine-staging/). Most of my prefixes before that were 32-bit so I needed to recreate them. One of those prefixes contained a Sims 3 install and I finally looked into that last weekend.

Information in here was valid at the time of writing, i.e. early October 2025 and Wine 10.16.

Unfortunately there's no `tl;dr` here as the process is a bit involved.

## Fixing unarc.dll

One of the DLLs that the FitGirl installer uses contains a bug in the code that's triggered when running under "new WoW64" due to its `VirtualAlloc` never reporting an error for the parameters it's called with, which causes the code to go into an infinite loop.

This can be fixed by making the following changes to `unarc.dll` itself :

```diff
 6108a933:	89 34 24             	mov    %esi,(%esp)
 6108a936:	e8 5d 01 00 00       	call   0x6108aa98
 6108a93b:	83 3e 00             	cmpl   $0x0,(%esi)

-6108a944:	89 df                	mov    %ebx,%edi
+6108a93e:	75 0f                	jne    0x6108a94f
+6108a940:	89 df                	mov    %ebx,%edi
+6108a942:	90                   	nop
+6108a943:	90                   	nop
+6108a944:	90                   	nop
+6108a945:	90                   	nop
 6108a946:	89 f8                	mov    %edi,%eax
 6108a948:	29 e8                	sub    %ebp,%eax
 6108a94a:	83 f8 01             	cmp    $0x1,%eax
```

The file offset where the changes start is `9d3e`.

The loop that eventually becomes infinite is skipped on the first successful call to `VirtualAlloc`, which in case of "new WoW64" is the very first call.

## cls-precomp.dll crashes

The next problem I faced was `cls-precomp.dll`, another decompressor component used by the installer, constantly crashing with the following backtrace :

```

```

Interestingly, the crash occurred with "new WoW64", "old WoW64", and 32-bit prefixes. Things work fine on Windows.

Despite the name, this isn't a DLL but a normal executable that's launched by the installer to process `sns` files by executing it like `cls-precomp -E 001.sns -o 001_.sns`. I could reproduce the crash reliably by just running the executable and one of the `sns` files extracted from one of the temp directories left behind by the installer when it crashed.

I've never tracked down the cause of the bug but setting `WINEDEBUG=warn+heap` somehow helps.

## Putting it all together

This assumes the following :
 * `$WINEPREFIX` is the prefix location that you're installing into,
 * `$SOURCEDIR` is the directory containing the repack files (`setup.exe` and all the `.bin`s),
 * `$USER` is the name of the user running Wine.

1. Launch a terminal window, set your `WINEPREFIX`, go to `$SOURCEDIR` and `wine setup.exe`.
2. Click through the installer, make sure to uncheck *Update DirectX* and the *Download* options at the bottom of the component list. Once you get to the window with the progress bar, it will get stuck at 0%.
3. In another terminal window, do `WINEPREFIX=/your/wine/prefix wineserver -k -w` to forcefully kill the installer so it doesn't have a chance to clean up its temporary files. Close this window once the installer is killed. Remove the directory you chose to install Sims 3 to in the installer as otherwise the next (potentially successful) run will fail.
4. Go to `${WINEPREFIX}/drive_c/users/${USER}/AppData/Local/Temp/`. You should find two directories in there. Copy `setup.tmp` from one of them to your `$SOURCEDIR` and copy `unarc.dll` from the other one to somewhere else.
5. Delete those two directories in `Temp`.
6. Modify `unarc.dll` as instructed above.
7. In the first terminal window, `export WINEDEBUG=warn+heap`, and launch `winedbg setup.tmp '/SL5=$2009C,6321655,140800,'"$(winepath --windows "${SOURCEDIR}")\setup.exe"`.
8. Tell the debugger to break when loading DLLs : `break LoadLibraryA` and `break LoadLibraryW`.
9. Have the debugger continue by issuing `c`, followed by enter. Keep continuing until the installer window opens. Set the options to the ones you actually want this time.
10. Before clicking `Install` in the last window, open `${WINEPREFIX}/drive_c/users/${USER}/AppData/Local/Temp/`. There should be only one directory in there, enter it.
11. Click `Install`. This will cause the debugger to break again. Keep doing `continue` until `unarc.dll` appears in the temporary directory.
12. Copy the modified `unarc.dll` over the original one, delete the breakpoints (`delete 1` and `delete 2`) and then `continue`. The installer will now run.

That's it. The installation took about 20 minutes on my Ryzen 5950X. You can run the game by going to `Game/Bin` in the installation directory and doing `wine TS3W.exe`. I also installed dxvk via winetricks but this isn't necessary.

If you want to have *all the content* (some of it is provided as `Sims3Pack` files which must be actually "installed" into the game first), you'll need to use the launcher which is incredibly flaky with Wine and requires `dotnet20` and `vcrun2005sp1` to be installed via winetricks. Once you have that, do `wine Sims3LauncherW.exe`, click *Downloads*, then *Select All* and *Install*. Another small window with a progress bar should pop up, wait until it completes and close the launcher.

## TS3W.exe crashes with a "Division by zero" error

`tl;dr` Change the byte in `TS3W.exe` at offset `0x21211c` from `F8` to `E8`.

This will happen only with some CPUs. This is the code that triggers this :
```
0x0061210a      mov eax, 4
0x0061210f      xor ecx, ecx
0x00612111      cpuid
0x00612113      mov dword [var_8h], eax
0x00612117      mov eax, dword [var_8h]
0x0061211b      sar eax, 26
0x0061211e      pop esi
0x0061211f      add eax, 1
// rest of epilogue
```

The value returned from this function (i.e. the value in `eax`) is then used as the divisor for something else. The value the code is after is contained in the six upper bits of EAX after a CPUID(EAX=4,ECX=0) which is supposed to be the *Maximum number of addressable IDs for processor cores in physical package, minus 1*.

However, if that value is the maximum allowed value, i.e. 63 or `0b111111`, then using `sar` to shift it to the right will cause `eax` to end up with an all-one bit pattern, i.e. `-1` in two's complement, due to `sar` copying the uppermost bit. Executing the `add eax, 1` later will result in setting it to zero. Replacing `sar` with `shr` (as noted in the `tl;dr`) fixes this, and the origin of this bug is probably an `int` being used instead of an `unsigned int` when doing the extractions in the original C code.

Both of my AMD CPUs (5950X and 5800X3D) return zeroes in all registers after a CPUID(EAX=4), though all CPUID related code might be skipped if the CPU is detected to be something else than a `GenuineIntel`, as I have not checked that deep. The trusty Intel Core i7-3632QM sets the field in question to 7 which makes sense as it's a 8-thread CPU. However, the i9-13950HX (where the crash originally happened) sets it to 63 which doesn't even make sense as it's a 32-thread CPU. Moreover, the N100 sets it to 63 as well which makes even less sense as it's a 4-thread CPU. It seems like the meaning of this field must have changed somehow (unless there's something I don't know and it is possible to have 64 *addressable IDs for processor cores in physical package* in a 32- or 4-thread CPU indeed) but Intel's Instruction Set Reference doesn't list 63 as a special value.
